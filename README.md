# Hash Map

Project Author: Sara Harder

This was the portfolio project for a data structures class at Oregon State University.

Provided with skeleton code including a previously created Dynamic Array, the files include a chainging hash map and an open addressing hash map.
Both include various functions for modifying the hash map, including putting onto it, getting from it, and removing from it.

Completed June 2022
